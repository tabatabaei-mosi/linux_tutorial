# Fundamentals 

## What is Linux?

Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn't function.

The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:

1. **Bootloader** –  The software that manages the boot process of your computer. For most users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.

2. **Kernel** – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called `Linux`. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.

3. **Init system** – This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is systemd? which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified Bootloader).

4. **Daemons** – These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.

5. **Graphical server** – This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.

6. **Desktop environment** – This is the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to choose from (GNOME, Cinnamon, 
Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment, KDE, Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games).

7. **Applications** – Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Just like Windows and macOS, Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that can be easily found and installed. Most modern Linux distributions (more on this below) include App Store-like tools that centralize and simplify application installation. For example, Ubuntu Linux has the Ubuntu Software Center (a rebrand of GNOME Software? Figure 1) which allows you to quickly search among the thousands of apps and install them from one centralized location.

## Why use Linux?

One of the biggest reasons for someone to switch to Linux is to use what is arguably the most powerful feature of the Linux operating system and that is the `terminal`. If you've ever seen a film where a hacker or a computer genius has sat behind their computer typing commands into what looks like a big black box on their computer screen that black box is called the **terminal**.

Now Linux is unique in that the development of Linux is inseparable from the terminal and this means that knowing how to use the terminal gives you pretty much absolute control over how your computer works by using the terminal. You can do pretty much anything that you want with your Linux computer. Now you can't get this level of control over your computer in any other operating system and this makes the terminal an incredible skill to learn.

Another important reason to switch and use Linux is that Linux is free and therefore most of world's servers run on Linux. This means that if you want to learn how to program or develop web applications or develop software in general, you're going to need to learn how to use Linux.

Don't worry about memorizing all the commands.

## What is a “distribution?”

Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a `flavor` of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).

Popular Linux distributions include:
- LINUX MINT
- MANJARO
- DEBIAN
- UBUNTU
- ANTERGOS
- SOLUS
- FEDORA
- ELEMENTARY OS
- OPENSUSE

Each distribution has a different take on the desktop. Some opt for very modern user interfaces (such as GNOME and Elementary OS’s Pantheon), whereas others stick with a more traditional desktop environment (openSUSE uses KDE). You can check out the top 100 distributions on the [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/).

And don’t think the server has been left behind. For this arena, you can turn to:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Ubuntu Server
- CentOS
- SUSE Enterprise Linux

Some of the above server distributions are free (such as Ubuntu Server and CentOS) and some have an associated price (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux). Those with an associated price also include support.

```{note}
In general, the more popular a distribution is, the more support you’ll find for it. This is especially true for server distributions. Among various distributions, it's recommended to use Ubuntu for beginners.
```

## Which distribution is right for you?

Which distribution you use will depend on the answer to three simple questions:
- How skilled of a computer user are you?
- Do you prefer a modern or a standard desktop interface?
- Server or desktop?

If your computer skills are fairly basic, you’ll want to stick with a newbie-friendly distribution such as `Linux Mint`, `Ubuntu`, `Elementary OS` or `Deepin`. If your skill set extends into the above-average range, you could go with a distribution like `Debian` or `Fedora`. If, however, you’ve pretty much mastered the craft of computer and system administration, use a distribution like `Gentoo`. If you really want a challenge, you can build your very own Linux distribution, with the help of Linux From Scratch.

If you’re looking for a server-only distribution, you will also want to decide if you need a desktop interface, or if you want to do this via command-line only. The `Ubuntu Server` does not install a GUI interface. This means two things: your server won’t be bogged down loading graphics and you’ll need to have a solid understanding of the Linux command line. However, you can install a GUI package on top of the `Ubuntu Server` with a single command like:

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
```

System administrators will also want to view a distribution with regards to features. Do you want a server-specific distribution that will offer you, out of the box, everything you need for your server? If so, `CentOS` might be the best choice. Or, do you want to take a desktop distribution and add the pieces as you need them? If so, `Debian` or `Ubuntu Linux` might serve you well.
